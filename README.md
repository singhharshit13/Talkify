I have made TalkifyX, a simple and responsive Text-to-Speech web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It lets users type any text, select from different voices, and listen to it instantly.  
I used the Web Speech API to handle speech synthesis, and made sure the UI works well on all screen sizes.
